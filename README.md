## Part 1

Workshop on binary search trees and breadth first search: 

* Get acquainted with tree terminology and binary search trees in the [quick-reference.md](quick-reference.md).
* Practice binary search tree tasks with [tree-practice/](tree-practice) sections "Tree and Binary Search Tree Warmup" and "Binary Search Tree Tasks".
* Check out breadth-first traversal and breadth-first search in 
[breadth-first/](breadth-first).

With extra time, try:
* Dive deeper into graphs, trees, and binary search trees in the [longer-reference.md](longer-reference.md).
* "Tree Tasks" section of [tree-practice/](tree-practice).
* Read more and try "Exercises" in the [breadth-first/](breadth-first) section, including coding tasks!

## Part 2

Workshop on tries and depth first search:

* Encounter tries in the [quick-reference.md](quick-reference.md).
* Learn about depth-first traversal and depth-first search in 
[depth-first/](depth-first).
* Practice trie tasks with  the "Trie Warmup" and "Trie Tasks" sections of [tree-practice/](tree-practice).

With extra time, try:
* Dive deeper into tries in the [longer-reference.md](longer-reference.md).
* Read more and try "Exercises" in the [depth-first/](depth-first) section, including coding tasks!
